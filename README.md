This project is a TypeScript to Rust transpiler, designed to convert TypeScript code into equivalent Rust code. It parses the TypeScript source code into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and generates Rust code from it. This tool aims to ease the transition from JavaScript/TypeScript applications to high-performance Rust codebases.

## Features

- Transpiles TypeScript syntax to Rust.
- Generates an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) from TypeScript code.
- Converts common TypeScript features (functions, classes, modules, etc.) to Rust equivalents.
- Provides options for customizing the output and handling specific TypeScript features like types and async/await.
- Error handling during transpilation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run this project, you need to have the following installed:

- <strong>Rust</strong>: The Rust programming language.
- <strong>Cargo</strong>: Rust package manager.
